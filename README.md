# Website for Housing Reservations

This project is meant to showcase technical proficiency in **Python, Django, RESTFUL APIs, React.js, Javascript, HTML/CSS**.

The website showcases all primary functions present in an [Airbnb Website](https://www.airbnb.ca/) including responsive design for both mobile and web applications.

As a **customer**, you have: making/cancelling a reservation, filtering options, making and viewing comments/reviews, general profile (name, phone number, address, etc), reservation recommendations and more.

As a **host**, you have: listing your property for reservations, responding to reservation requests, comments/reviews, general profile (name, phone number, address, etc) and more.

# To Run: 

Navigate to frontend folder and run `npm start`

Create a one user and have them add and list various properties.
Create a second user and them add and list various (different) properties.
